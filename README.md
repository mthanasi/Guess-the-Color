## RGB Color Model

The RGB color model is an additive color model in which red, green and blue light are added together in various ways to reproduce a broad array of colors. The name of the model comes from the initials of the three additive primary colors, red, green, and blue.

The syntax of RGB is as follows: ```rgb(r, g, b)```, where the value of each color range between 0 and 255. Black is at ```rgb(0, 0, 0)```, and white is at ```rgb(255, 255, 255)```.
